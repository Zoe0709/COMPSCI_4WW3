## Description: 
MuseuM Master is a website that helps users discover museums around the world. Finding and exploring favorite museums are difficult, and an improper choice of museum can waste your precious time and money. With our museum finder, that will not be a problem. MuseuM Master allows users to search for museums by names or ratings so they can pick up interested museums to visit. For each individual museum, users can view all comments and ratings to gain comprehensive understanding of it. Detailed information such as address, phone number, open hours, and description is also exhibited. When new museums are discovered, any user can submit them to the website with details.
